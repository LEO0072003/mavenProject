export const FREQUENT_QUESTIONS = [
  {
    ques: "What is the best time to visit the Andaman Islands?",
    ans: "One always wishes to visit Andaman during the most pleasant months to enjoy each bit of it. The best time to visit the Andaman Islands is during the months of November to April. During this time, the weather is pleasant and favours all water-activities.",
  },
  {
    ques: "Can I customise my Andaman Tour Package?",
    ans: "With Maven Adventures, you need not worry about paying extra. You can get a customised Andaman Tour Package as well. Just make sure to contact us (add link to contact page) and let us know what customisation would you like in your Andaman Tour Package",
  },
  {
    ques: "How is the mobile network and connectivity in the Andaman Islands?",
    ans: "Mobile network and connectivity in the Andaman Islands can be spotty and inconsistent. In Port Blair, the capital, and some  popular tourist spots like Havelock Island, you'll generally find decent coverage, especially with major Indian telecom providers like BSNL, Airtel, and Jio. However, as you move to more remote areas or smaller islands, the signal can weaken, and internet speeds may drop significantly. It's a good idea to plan for limited connectivity, especially if you're heading to less populated places.",
  },
  {
    ques: "How do I book my Andaman Tour Package?",
    ans: "Here at Maven Adventures, we have made the booking procedure quite simple. All you need to do is select a tour package that suits your budget and your needs and click on the book now button. Our in-house team will be there for you and guide you through any issues while booking.",
  },
  {
    ques: "What are the must-visit locations in the Andaman Islands?",
    ans: "The must-visit locations if you are travelling to the Andaman Islands include Cellular Jail, Radhanagar Beach, Ross Island, Neil Island, and Havelock Island. If you are travelling to the Andaman Islands, make sure to visit these places to have the best experience of the place.",
